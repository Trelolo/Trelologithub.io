				<p class="paragraph_1">The Castle Land project invites users to assemble their digital collection, consisting of castle elements, made in the form of excellent 3D models. Tower by tower, wall by wall. Build your own unique castle!</p>
				<p class="paragraph_2">Among the collectible items you can find fabulous and real towers, walls, dungeons, forges, stables, barracks, wells and much more. Don't be limited to anything!  3D Castle Land Collectibles offers archaic, medieval, gothic and futuristic styles.</p>
				<p class="paragraph_3">All the elements of the collection are compatible with each other, which gives unlimited scope for creating a unique castle. You can assemble all the elements of the collection into a single whole in the Castle Land branded application.</p>

				<h2 class="abot">What is the peculiarity of the project?</h2>
				<p class="paragraph_4">Unlike the mainstream direction - collecting nft tokens stored in blockchains, this project offers a different scheme for collecting and confirming the authenticity and uniqueness of each element of the collection. The ideology of the 3D Castle Land Collectibles project is an abstraction from speculative schemes that turn nft collecting into an absurd money bubble. It so happens that often nft collectors are just speculators. They buy collectibles not because of their passion for digital art, but for the sake of making a profit by reselling the item at a higher price due to the growth of the cryptocurrency, which stores the nft token on the blockchain. 3D Castle Land Collectibles does not have a blockchain in the usual sense. It's simple: you buy yourself a collection item for a fixed price, and its uniqueness is easily verified in the proprietary 3D Castle Land Collectibles application. At any time, you can sell your collection item according to the P2P trading rule, where the participants of the transaction set the value of this item <span class="colortext">THEMSELVES</span>. In addition, you can exchange your collection items for others from the project participants, naturally, giving or receiving a <span class="colortext">UNIQUE</span> element of the collection. In a word, the old principles of collecting in modern digital implementation!</p>
